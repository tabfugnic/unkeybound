# Unkeybound

This library hopes to solve the problem of web interfaces rebinding
keys nonstandard ways.

Quite often text fields, in order to provide a more rich experience,
will rebind standard readline keybindings in favor of their own
flavor. This would be fine if each interface gave you the ability to
systematically turn that off. This library hopes to fix that.
